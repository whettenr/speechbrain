# K-means (Quantization)
This folder contains recipes for training K-means clustering model for the LJSpeech Dataset.
The model serves to quantize self-supervised representations into discrete representation. Thus representations can be used as a discrete audio input for various tasks including classification, ASR and speech generation.
It supports kmeans model using the features from  HuBERT, WAVLM or Wav2Vec.

## Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

# How to run:
To configure the SSL model type and corresponding Hub in your YAML configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `model_config` section in your YAML file.
2. Modify the `ssl_model_type` field to specify one of the SSL models: "Hubert", "WavLM", or "Wav2Vec2".
3. Update the `ssl_hub` field with the specific name of the SSL Hub associated with your chosen model type.
Here are the supported SSL models along with their corresponding SSL Hubs:
```
ssl_model_type: hubert, wavlm, wav2vec2
ssl_hub:
  - facebook/hubert-large-ll60k
  - microsoft/wavlm-large
  - facebook/wav2vec2-large
```
4. Set the output folder according to the experiments you are running (e.g., `output_folder: !ref results/LJSpeech/clustering/wavlm/<seed>`)

To initiate training using a specific SSL model, execute the following command:


```shell
python train.py hparams/train_discrete_ssl.yaml
```
This command will start the training process using the configurations specified in 'train_discrete_ssl.yaml'.
